# Project: Landing Page
My very first project where i implement both HTML and CSS(with my knowledge of Flexbox).
## Thought Process
This Webpage was created from a design provided by "The Odin Project" with the freedom to customize as i deem fit.
I chose to go with coding as my theme as i found this snippet, 
```
    while (alive){
        eat();
        sleep();
        code();
        repeat();
    }
```
