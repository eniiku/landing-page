# Project: Landing Page
My very first project where i implement both HTML and CSS(with my knowledge of Flexbox).
## Thought Process
This Webpage was created from a design provided by "The Odin Project" with the freedom to customize as i deem fit.
I chose to go with coding as my theme as i found this snippet, 
```
    while (alive){
        eat();
        sleep();
        code();
        repeat();
    }
```
by Gazi Jarin really clever and really funny.
## Conclusion
Webpage done! I didnt try to go crazy with my ideas or creativity, simpling following the template and color schemes. Also this webpage is not optimized for computer/laptops.
